## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple example steps.

## Prerequisites

Before attempting to get a copy of this, you should know(have) how to do the following:

- How to use the command line interface(CLI)

- Know how to navigate directories or folders at the CLI.

- Know how to get the URL(https/ssh) of a repository on GitHub.

- You should have a code editor installed, preferably VsCode.

## Setup

- In desired folder or directory in the CLI, run the command:

>                 git clone (https/ssh)URL

- Navigate into the cloned folder or repository by running the command:

>                cd <folder/name of the repository>
